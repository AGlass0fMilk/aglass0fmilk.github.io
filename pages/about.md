# Hi! I'm George! 

I am an embedded software engineer and car enthusiat, among other things.

This website is a scratchpad for me. You can stay up to date on the fascinating things I do :)

I've wanted to start a blog for a long time -- a few years actually. So I have quite a backlist of posts and many pictures to go through... So from time to time I may make posts backdated by a while :D

My interests include mainly embedded electronics, automotive technology, classic cars, rowing, cycling ([come Zwift with me](https://www.zwift.com/athlete/c19624ad-7b51-442f-b20a-ad8291ff2268)), and a myriad of other random hobbies. I love making new things and making things new!

I started programming in 2009 and got interested in electronics around 2011 because I stumbled upon [hackaday.com](https://hackaday.com/), perhaps even using [stumbleupon.com](https://stumbleupon.com/). Does anyone do that anymore, even? That's _so 2014_. As a last-cutoff-year millenial I'm starting to feel old...

I can even recall my first hackaday forum post asking "How do I get started in electronics?" 

10 years on and here I am. Maybe someday I will link to that post, when I feel like digging it up!

A professional embedded software engineer by trade, I am active contributor to [Mbed-OS](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os "click me!"), among other open-source projects. I have been contributing to Mbed-OS for a few years now, and I love focusing on platform-level software design problems. I am a huge fan of Nordic Semiconductor and ST Micro platforms, with many complex projects under my belt using both.

I have extensive experience with a number of embedded technologies and protocols, most prominently Bluetooth Low Energy, USB, CAN bus, embedded displays, and many more.

# The Shack on Wheels

When it's not snowing here in Western New York _and_ if I'm not playing with electronics, you can probably find me in my garage working on something. I like old cars, mainly MGB's and Jeeps. 

My latest project and retirement plan, the namesake for this website, is a 1973 GMC MotorHome originally bought by my grandfather brand new. It's been in my family ever since. And yes, I've taken road trips in it! Only when I was a kid, but still I have fond memories of the thick shag carpet. Close to 50 years on, it needs _just a bit_ of work...

Follow along as I restore my future "Shack on Wheels" :)
